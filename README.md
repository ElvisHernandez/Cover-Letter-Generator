This Chrome Extension is a simple to use Cover Letter Generator meant to help you on your job search!

The app consists of roughly two parts

- Front-End

  Built with Plasmo which is a react based framework used for building Chrome Extensions.

- Back-End

  Built with Firebase services like Firebase Functions, Auth, and Realtime Database.

The secret sauce here is the Chat GPT API that allows us to summarize relevant skills/experience and generate a cover letter given a job description.

To use the app you'll need three things, an OpenAI API key, a google account (for auth), and a resume. After signing up and entering your API key and resume, you'll be able to start analyzing job descriptions to generate cover letters.
